# Word-Cloud
Users can implement binary search tree to count words and their counts in text, allowing users to make their own word clouds.
The neat thing about word clouds is that words are displayed in a size proportional to the number of times they are used in the text on which the cloud is based. (Note that very common words, also known as stopwords, are typically not
included in the cloud. Otherwise, all English word clouds would be dominated by “the”, “and”, “a”, “in”, etc.)
